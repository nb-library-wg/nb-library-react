To get started running this locally just:

    git clone https://github.com/noisebridge/nb-library-react.git
    git checkout dev
    npm install
    npm start

Using https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/no-match for the client side routing.

Any files put in the public directory will be served up kind of like you'd expect from a simple express server. So there are static files like images we might use like the noisebridge gif.
